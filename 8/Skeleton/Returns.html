            <a name ="Returns"><h2 class="productInformation curveRadius">Returns &amp; Refunds</h2></a>

            <p>Our returns policy lasts 28 days, meaning you have 28 days from receiving your goods to contact us if you wish to return the items. If 28 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can&rsquo;t offer you a refund or exchange.</p>
            <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.</p>
            <p>If the returned item has been USED, DAMAGED or is not in its ORIGINAL PACKAGING we are unable to offer a full refund and there will be a 20% charge of the original purchase price to cover the fact we will no longer be able to resell the item for its full value.</p>
            <p>Before returning your item, we suggest that you take photographs of the item and its packaging as a visual record of its condition. In the event of any damage caused in transit having a visual record of the condition of the item before it was sent will speed up the returns process and stop a returned item being refused due to damage.</p>
            <p>We do not accept products that are hazardous materials, or contain flammable liquids or gases, please ensure that any products that require petrol have the tanks drained and the battery wire is disconnected in the case of battery powered items.</p>
            <p>To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
            <p>Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.</p>
            <p>Please contact customer service before returning your item so that we are aware of the return, failure to do so may result in a delay in processing your refund.</p>
            <p>If we are arranging the return we will advise you of any charges that you may be liable for before arranging the collection with the courier. We will arrange a suitable day with you but are unable to provide a specific time for the courier to collect. If you miss the collection we will have to charge for this as we are charged for missed collection, if you believe you will not be in for the collection please notify us as soon as possible and we will try to cancel the collection though if this is not possible we will have to charge for the missed collection.</p>
            <p>If you are arranging the return yourself we recommend using a trackable service as we cannot be held responsible for returns that are lost in transit. If we arrange the return there will be a charge that will cover the cost of the courier as well as an admin charge, this will be deducted from your refund, customer service will advise you of this charge before the return is arranged.</p>
            <p>Please remember the product remains yours until successfully received and signed for by a member of our warehouse staff.</p>
            <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund</p>
            <p>If you are approved, we aim to process your refund within 5 working days, a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment within 3-7 working days, depending on your payment method.</p>
            <p>If you haven&rsquo;t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.</p>
            <p>Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you&rsquo;ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at&nbsp;<a class="email" href="mailto:info@outdoortoys.co.uk">info@outdoortoys.co.uk</a>.</p>

            <a name ="SaleItems"><h2 class="productInformation curveRadius">Sale items</h2></a>
            <p>Only regular priced items may be refunded, unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded.</p>

            <a name ="Gifts"><h2 class="productInformation curveRadius">Gifts</h2></a>
            <p>If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you&rsquo;ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.</p>
            <p>If the item wasn&rsquo;t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he will find out about your return.</p>

            <a name ="Shipping"><h2 class="productInformation curveRadius">Shipping</h2></a>
            <p>To return your product, you should contact Customer Service first, this is because different products require different mailing addresses.</p>
            <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>
            <p>Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.</p>
            <p>If you are shipping an item over &pound;50, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don&rsquo;t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</p>
