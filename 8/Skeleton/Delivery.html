            <p>1. *Standard delivery is free of charge on orders of more than £100 to all UK postcodes, excluding orders
                that require 2 people to deliver the item(s). Details on whether your delivery is a 2 man job will be in
                the basket area or while you are going through the order confirmation process. Excludes also apply for
                some Scottish Mainland postcodes, the Scottish Highlands, Northern Ireland, Isle of Wight & Any Other
                Off Shore Locations. Sadly we cannot ship to the&nbsp;Channel Islands or the Isle of Man at present.</p>
            <p>2. *Most stock items are delivered by Parcel Force,&nbsp;APC or Royal Mail and are usually despatched
                within 24h of your order, again, except for 2 delivery people that can take up to 3 working days to
                dispatch due to how big the item is and the process needed to delivery it to you. Please note we do not
                despatch orders on weekends or bank holidays and during busy periods such as Black Friday, Christmas
                etc. dispatch may be 48h. </p>
            <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: Larger items, for example Quads, Climbing frames etc. are delivered by
                Pallet Service and will take extra time to deliver (48h+) as the courier will need to contact you to
                arrange a delivery time (please make sure that you have provided us with an up to date phone number as
                the courier will need this in order to contact you to arrange delivery, failure to do so may delay
                delivery.</p>
            <p>Items that we Dropship directly from the manufactures (BERG, Plum, Quickplay, Kidkraft, Samba, Little
                Tikes, TP Toys &amp; Smoby) will have delivery times set by the relevant manufacturers and your expected
                delivery date will be stated on the product page when you place your order (this is generally between 7
                - 10 working days from your order date)</p>
            <p>3.&nbsp; You will receive a shipping notification email on the day that we dispatch your order and any
                items being delivered by courier should also result in you receiving tracking emails as the items pass
                through each stage of the delivery process.</p>
            <p>4. If there is an issue with your order we will notify you as soon as possbile, please ensure you have
                provided a correct phone number and email address. If the item you have ordered is out of stock we will
                phone and then email, if there is no response, to discuss your order and offer alternatives if possible.
                If we have not heard a response from yourself within 48hours we will refund your order in full back to
                the payment method (this may take between 3 - 7 days due to banks procedures)</p>
            <p>5. Like every other internet or mail order retailer, we have no control over problems that occur in
                transit that lead to delays in delivery of your order. Whilst we completely understand the frustration
                that delays cause, we cannot be held responsible for any delays caused by 3rd party couriers and
                therefore cannot offer discounts or compensation for delays in delivery.</p>
            <p>6. Please make sure that you are able to be at home for a delivery if a day/date has been confirmed, as
                some failed deliveries are liable to redelivery costs at a rate of 50% of our original delivery
                charges.</p>
            <p>7. Please do not reject a delivery if the box is damaged. We do our best to ensure that all of our
                products are adequately protected during transit, so a damaged box will very rarely result in a damaged
                product. In the event that your item is damaged, we operate a 48 hour spare parts service and carry
                thousands of brand new spare parts in stock for immediate dispatch. Where possible, we will ALWAYS
                replace parts before accepting returns where items arrive damaged or develop a fault that can be fixed
                with a replacement part.</p>
            <p>8.&nbsp;If we are arranging collection of a faulty item from you, someone from customer service will
                discuss the details with you over the phone to arrange a suitable day.&nbsp;Once the collection request
                has been made with the courier you will receive an email from us confirming the details of the
                collections including the date, courier etc. if you are unavailable on the arranged date contact us as
                soon as possible, if the collection fails we will have to charge for arranging a second collection.</p>
            <p>You will also receive the Returns Form which you will need to attach to the items packaging as well as
                details of how the item needs to be packaged for the courier to except it, items that have not been
                properly repackaged may be refused by the courier and we will have to charge if a second collection
                needs to be arranged.</p>

            <a name="NextDay"><h3 class="whiteBox curveRadius">Our 3pm Next Day Delivery Policy</h3></a>
            <p>We aim to despatch all orders within 24/48 hours of us receiving your order and the vast majority are
                delivered within 48h (this applies to orders placed before 2pm,&nbsp;we cannot be held responsible for
                any delays caused by 3rd party couriers and therefore cannot offer discounts or compensation for delays
                in delivery).</p>
            <p>Deliveries generally take place between the hours of 8am and 6pm Monday to Friday (we are closed weekends
                and Bank Holidays and therefore do not deliver on those days, orders where Next Day Delivery has been
                selected but are placed either after 2pm or on a weekend or Bank Holiday will be despatched the next
                working day) a calling card will be left if there is no-one at home to sign for your order.</p>
            <p>The majority of our orders are sent via APC or Royal Mail, but larger items can also be delivered via a
                specialist heavy goods carrier PALLEX.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It is your responsibility to check your delivery on receipt of your order and notify us as soon as
                possible if there is any missing parts or damage.&nbsp;</p>


            <a name="ChangeAddress"><h3 class="whiteBox curveRadius">Change of Delivery Address</h3></a>

                different delivery address when placing your order please contact customer service who will be happy to
                assist.</p>


            <a name="FailedDelivery"><h3 class="whiteBox curveRadius">Failed Deliveries</h3></a>

            <p>If a customer misses multiple attempted deliveries of their order and the item is returned back to
                ourselves as undelivered, we are happy to refund or resend the order, however there will be a charge to
                cover the attempted deliveries, return delivery and admin costs.</p>

            <a name="CollectionReturns"><h3 class="whiteBox curveRadius">Collections and Returns (Failed Collections)</h3></a>

            <p>If you are returning an item, no matter the reason the item must be boxed, a courier will refuse to
                collect the item if it is not properly boxed and we will charge for failed collections. It is your
                <span>responsibility</span>&nbsp;to ensure the item is correctly boxed and we will need your
                confirmation that this is the case prior to a collection being arranged by ourselves.</p>
            <p>We strongly advise that you keep the box the item arrived in in case you need to return it for any reason
                or you will need to source a box before we will arrange a collection.</p>


            <a name="CancellingOrders"><h3 class="whiteBox curveRadius">Cancelling orders</h3>
            </a>

            <p>If you wish to cancel an order that has NOT been dispatched you must contact us immediately, if we are
                able to stop the orders dispatch you will be refunded in full.</p>
            <p>Should you wish to cancel goods that have left our Warehouse, orders will be subject to a returns charge
                plus an admin charge. Returns charges can vary depending on the size of the product and are determined
                by our courier company, you will be informed of this charge once we have confirmation that the item is
                on its way back to our warehouse and the charge will be deducted from the refund when it is issued.</p>


            <a name="DeliveryExcess"><h3 class="whiteBox curveRadius">Delivery Excess:</h3></a>

                you will be contacted prior to dispatch to advise you of this charge. We do try to include all affected
                postcodes in the following list, but there are others than can apply depending on the courier company
                used to delivery your order. Please get in touch with us prior to placing your order if you live in an
                area that usually requires an extra delivery cost.</p>

                manufacturer and there are some restrictions on delivery outside of Mainland UK meaning that it may not
                be possible to deliver to certain postcodes&nbsp;(even if your order goes through at checkout this does
                not mean that we are able to deliver to your postcode or that the delivery you have paid is accurate,
                our checkout is an automated service and as such we are unable to adjust it for individual
                manufacturers). If we can arrange delivery for these postcodes there may be an extra delivery charge,
