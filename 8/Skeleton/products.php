Need to bring in the heavy machinery? Aged 3 – 7 years? Well if you’ve answered yes to the last one (the first two questions sound too much like work!) you’ll be as excited about our newest ride-on as we are because this 12V digger is almost too much fun! This 12V Ride On digger with 360 degree turn and working bucket is controlled by easy to use joysticks. Push them both forward, and go forward, pull them both back to go into reverse and if you push them in opposite directions, well we suggest you keep an eye on that bucket because that’s how you spin and you’re not going to want to stop! Filled with great extra’s this digger also has a working bucket with a separate joystick control to operate it. But don’t worry when you get tired of working there’s a parental remote control and even a telescopic push handle so you can just sit back and let someone else take the strain at the end of a busy work day.</description><picture>0004.png</picture></product>\n",
