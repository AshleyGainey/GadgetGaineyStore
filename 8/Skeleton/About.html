            <!--Heading 2 to give a brief explanation to our business-->
            <h2>We have always been about Customer Experience!</h2>

            <!--Description about the company-->
            <p>Gadget Gainey was established by Ashley Gainey, who was really interested in a service that no other
                company focuses on... the customer service side. This is a true pet peeve to Ashley if you didn't have a
                great experience then why would you ever want to go back to that service ever again? Ashley always liked
                talking to Customer Service because most of the time, they asked how he was and yeah maybe he should
                have said he was fine but he explained a little bit about his day and got chatting to someone that was
                their very first day at this big online store, they said that they hope to have someone that shared an
                interest in their job and in what they do every day! </p>

            <p>His goal was to just Dropship items. Which is what we still do now, our motto is that we are Providing
                you with the best products with a great price! We care for our customers and for that, that is key to
                success. To this day, Ashley does everything, orders the items, social media ads, listings items on this
                site as well as items on our eBay store but also, what job does he love the most... customer
                service! </p>

            <p>Unfortunately though, Ashley now has other commitments, he has a full-time job, he also studies. With
                having a Degree Apprenticeship, he doesn't have much time to expand, so now we, Jade and Chris have
                stepped up to the plate and are now filling what he does. Ashley still does a bit when he can, but we
                are trying to get ready for Phase 2 of Gadget Gainey which is to have a store that we can sell our
                products on, instead of redirecting to eBay!</p>
